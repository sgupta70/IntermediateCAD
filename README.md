## Pull Copter 

### Description

For this assignment we were given a random partner and together we had to make a pull copter. Each partner had their own parts to make and it was split into 5 different parts. In 4.1 one person made the ring and the other made the spinner. Then in 4.2 one made the key and the other made the prop. In 4.3 we worked together to assemble the launcher, and in 4.4-4.5 we branched and merged the Onshape document to make our own prop.

### Reflection 4.1 
In 4.1 I was assigned student A, for this part I had to make the ring. This assignment was pretty easy for me, I just followed the instructins given to me. I was able to use the part given to get the lines that I would need for the ring. I then did a sketch of the ring size and extruded in between the two circles I drew. I added some fillets and the ring was done.
